# Welcome TEAM-1 to your personal QEC Github Repository!

Use this Repository to keep track of your project changes and collaborate on code.



# As a key note... Push your progress every hour!

Push any changes to your project EVERY HOUR, this is a **requirement** outlined in the delegate package and **failure to do so could be grounds for disqualification!!!** The updates dont have to be strictly 60 minutes apart, but there should be roughly 1 every hour.



# How to use

For newbie information about using Github, refer to https://shortest.link/2vAe .

You can also manually reupload project files (or edit their code using the little pencil) through the Online Github Interface if you are more comfortable with that. 



Either is fine so long as there are consistent changes/developments being made every hour.

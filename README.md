# Welcome TEAM-1 to your personal QEC Github Repository!

Use this Repository to keep track of your project changes and collaborate on code.



# As a key note... Push your progress every hour!

Push any changes to your project EVERY HOUR, this is a **requirement** outlined in the delegate package and **failure to do so could be grounds for disqualification!!!** The updates dont have to be strictly 60 minutes apart, but there should be roughly 1 every hour.



# How to use

# Installation Requirements
```Node``` and ```npm``` must be installed for 

Run ```npm i```

# Note on External Resources
## Commenting
For the web application, ```npx create-react-app``` was run to initialize it. This generated a sizable amount of code that sets up the application. As this code was not written by the team, comments explaining the code line by line are not provided. This holds true for other template code, and the link it was sourced from will be included in the file that uses it. The breakdown of library components used is not  provided for the same reason.
## The dotenv Package
This package allows all constants in the front end to be stored in one file, so that they can be easily changed. This file can be found in ```/web_app/client/.env```
